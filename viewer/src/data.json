We are ready, but the other side needs to be ready for both negotiations and compromises.”Reuters reported last month that Putin was open to discussing a Ukraine ceasefire deal with Trump, but ruled out making any major territorial concessions and insisted Kyiv abandon its ambitions to join NATO.Putin said on Thursday that Russia had no conditions to start talks with Ukraine and was ready to negotiate with anyone, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.But he said any deal could only be signed with Ukraine’s legitimate authorities, which for now the Kremlin considered to be only the Ukrainian parliament.Zelenskyy, whose term was due to expire earlier this year but has been extended due to martial law, would need to be re-elected for Moscow to consider him a legitimate signatory to any deal to ensure it was legally watertight, said Putin.Putin dismissed the idea of agreeing a temporary truce with Kyiv, saying only a long-lasting peace deal with Ukraine would suffice.Any talks should take as their starting point a preliminary agreement reached between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in the early weeks of the war at talks in Istanbul, which was never implemented, he added.Some Ukrainian politicians regard that draft deal as akin to a capitulation which would have neutered Ukraine’s military and political ambitions.\nWARRussia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and triggered the biggest crisis in relations between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.Russia, which casts the conflict as a defensive special military operation designed to stop dangerous NATO expansion to the east, controls around a fifth of Ukraine and has taken several thousand square kilometres of territory this year.Determined to incorporate four Ukrainian regions into Russia, Moscow’s forces have taken village after village in the east and are now threatening strategically important cities such as Pokrovsk, a major road and rail hub.Putin said the fighting was complex, so it was “difficult and pointless to guess what lies ahead… (but) we are moving, as you said, towards solving our primary tasks, which we outlined at the beginning of the special military operation.”Discussing the continued presence of Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk region, Putin said Kyiv’s troops would be forced out, but declined to say exactly when that would happen.The war has transformed the Russian economy and Putin said it was showing signs of overheating which was stoking worryingly high inflation. But he said growth was higher than many other economies such as Britain.Asked if he’d do anything differently, he said he should have sent troops into Ukraine sooner than 2022 and that Russia should have been better prepared for the conflict.Asked by a BBC reporter if he’d looked after Russia, something that Boris Yeltsin had asked him to do before handing over the presidency at the end of 1999, Putin said he had.”We have moved back from the edge of the abyss,” Putin said.“I have done everything to ensure that Russia is an independent and sovereign power that is able to make decisions in its own interests.”Russia, Putin said, had made proposals to Syria’s new rulers about Russia’s military bases there and most people that Moscow had spoken to on the issue favoured them staying.\nRussia would need to think about whether the bases should remain or not, he added, but rumours about the death of Russian influence in the Middle East were exaggerated.Putin touted what he said was the invincibility of the “Oreshnik” hypersonic missile that Russia has already test-fired at a Ukrainian military factory, saying he was ready to organise another launch at Ukraine and see if Western air defence systems could shoot it down.In Brussels, Zelenskyy addressed Putin’s missile suggestion during a press conference at a European Council meeting, remarking of Putin: “Do you think he is a sane person?”You want to be the smartest in the room.You want access to our award-winning journalism.You don’t want to be misled and misinformed.Ambedkarite student organisations protested at Savitribai Phule Pune University, demanding a full-time registrar, a drugs-free campus, better security, and action against discrimination faced by Dalit, Adivasi and Bahujan students.

The new class of GLP-1 receptor agonists, that included drugs such as semaglutide and tirzepatide, “have the potential to be transformative,” they say.Dr Francesca Celletti and Dr Francesco Branca from WHO’s department of Nutrition and Food Safety and Dr Jeremy Farrar, chief scientist at WHO  wrote, “Efforts to slow the obesity pandemic have focused almost exclusively on policies that help embed healthy diets and regular physical activity … Although there is good evidence on the effectiveness of such policies …, it is time to recognise that multi-sectoral efforts to influence behaviours … have so far failed to treat obesity or turn the tide on the obesity pandemic. In this context, the new class of GLP-1 RAs have the potential to be transformative.”This endorsement comes at a time when patents for the popular drug semaglutide are set to expire over the next couple of years in several countries, including India and Brazil. In India, several manufacturers of generic compounds have already started bioequivalence trials for their products so that they can be ready for use once the patents expire. Bioequivalence trials are conducted to ensure that generic versions of the products are as safe and effective as the branded versions. Several new medicines in this category are also under trial globally.Globally, one in eight people were living with obesity in 2022. There were 890 million adults and 160 million adolescents living with obesity in 2022. The prevalence of obesity has doubled in adults since 1990 and quadrupled in adolescents, according to the WHO. In India, there were 44 million women and 26 million men living with obesity in 2022. In the three decades between 1990 to 2022, the prevalence of obesity in women increased 8.6 percentage points and prevalence in men increased 4.9 percentage points. There has also been a significant increase in childhood obesity in the three decades. While 0.2 million boys and 0.2 million girls were obese in 1990, 7.3 million boys and 5.2 million girls were obese in 2022. WHO scientists say that global costs associated with obesity are likely to reach $3 trillion by 2030. In countries with 30 per cent prevalence of obesity, it could absorb up to 18 per cent of the national health expenditure. Scientists also argue that obesity adds to mortality — there were five million obesity-related deaths from non-communicable diseases in 2019. This accounted for 12 per cent of all deaths from non-communicable diseases worldwide.Will WHO also release guidelines for use?The WHO is currently in the process of drafting guidelines for the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with obesity to provide clarity on “clinical indications, application and programmatic considerations globally.” These guidelines are likely to be published in July 2025.What are popular diabetes cum weight loss drugs?Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic, originally approved in 2017 for type 2 diabetes, gained immense popularity as doctors prescribed it off-label for obesity, sparking a social media frenzy and supply shortages. In 2021, the USFDA approved Wegovy, another semaglutide-based drug from Novo Nordisk, marking the first chronic weight management treatment in a decade. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly’s Zepbound, approved in 2023, and its diabetes drug Mounjaro, also used off-label for weight loss, have joined the ranks of high-demand therapies for obesity care.While the new therapies have shown to reduce body weight between 10 and 25 per cent, experts have said it should not be used by all as there are severe side effects such as gastroparesis (stomach paralysis), pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas) and thyroid cancer. Another important consideration is that a person is likely to gain weight when they stop using the medicine and it is yet to be seen whether the drug can keep working over several years.Given the high costs of the products, the high demand and the production and supply challenges, scientists have also raised the issue of “counterfeit products” and grey markets. However, the medicines are likely to become more readily available as they get off patents.You want to be the smartest in the room.You want access to our award-winning journalism.You don’t want to be misled and misinformed.Chhagan Bhujbal: 'I am not consulted for anything now'Subscriber OnlyWhat Indian PM's first visit to Kuwait in 4 decadesSubscriber Only12 issues that made headlines in 2024Subscriber OnlyRaj Kapoor @ 100: The showman whose magic dazzles usSubscriber OnlyHindi cinema's best to worst in 2024Subscriber OnlyHow One Hundred Years of Solitude turned into a screenplayHow raagas can heal: A life in music and memoriesSubscriber OnlyBandish Bandits Season 2 review: No straggly spots, only theBhupen Khakhar made a virtue of painting pain, he sufferedSubscriber OnlyThe Lord of the Rings The War of the RohirrimWhy not replace car horns with bird sounds?Subscriber OnlyHeretic movie review: Hugh Grant elevates A24 horror film Anonna Dutt is a Principal Correspondent who writes primarily on health at the Indian Express.

It is a part of the Central Vista Redevelopment Project and is set to span approximately 1.55 lakh square metre, overtaking The Louvre in Paris, presently the world’s biggest.It will be implemented in two phases — the first comprising the retrofitting of North Block into a museum space, with an estimated deadline of June 2026 — officials told The Indian Express. The initial mapping of the building has already been done in consultation with officials from the France Museums Development, who will advise on best practices towards the reuse of heritage buildings without having to disturb its character, they said.As part of the agreement, India and France are collaborating on a comprehensive feasibility study, encompassing museum case studies, interpretive planning, and building programming. “France’s expertise in museum development, exemplified by the Grand Louvre, will play a pivotal role in shaping this project,” said Union Culture Minister Gajendra Shekhawat.Under the Central Vista plan, the North Block — which currently houses the offices of Ministries of Finance and Home Affairs — and the South Block are set to be moved to the Common Central Secretariat (CCS) buildings on Janpath.  The North Block is likely to be vacated by March 2025, while the South Block, which houses the Prime Minister’s Office and Ministry of External Affairs offices, will be vacated and readied in due course, officials said.Once it is vacated in the next three months, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) will restore North Block to its original state by removing all the additions that were made over the years and repairing the high-use areas that have been worn down since the British inaugurated New Delhi in 1931. North Block had around 400 rooms to start with, but over the years, partitions were added and the number doubled. The CPWD will float a tender soon for the restoration of North Block.Speaking on the occasion, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that India and France see each other as important poles in this multipolar world, calling theirs a “very strong relationship”. “When you hear India and France talk about how we see the world in our way, not necessarily in terms of how others might want to define it, it’s our history and heritage that give us the confidence to take those positions. So when we deepen our cultural collaboration, we are also actually adding to a particular kind of relationship which we believe would create a new and more democratic world government,” Jaishankar added.You want to be the smartest in the room.You want access to our award-winning journalism.You don’t want to be misled and misinformed.

In recent times, the invocation of Sections 498A, 376, 377, 506 of the IPC as a combined package in most of the complaints related to matrimonial disputes is a practice which has been condemned by this Court on several occasions”, said a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and N Koteshwar Singh.The court said this while dissolving a marriage by exercising its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to a couple who had a fall out after living together for only 3-4 months.The woman filed a case of rape against her husband, a US citizen, which led to his arrest and detention for almost a month.Writing for the bench, Justice Nagarathna noted that the rape FIR “interestingly…was filed by” her the “on the same day when she was scheduled to appear before the Family Court in the divorce case filed by the…husband.” The court said the wife “has taken contradictory positions with respect to her intentions about her marriage. On the one hand, she has stated that she has been a dutiful wife and has happily resided with the respondent-husband, but simultaneously she has filed a criminal complaint against the respondent-husband, alleging serious offences like cruelty, outraging of modesty, rape, cheating, etc.”The ruling noted that “in certain cases, the wife and her family tend to use a criminal complaint with all the above serious offences as a platform for negotiation and as a mechanism and a tool to get the husband and his family to comply with their demands, which are mostly monetary in nature.”The bench said “we have serious reservations with the tendency of parties seeking maintenance or alimony as an equalisation of wealth with the other party.”You want to be the smartest in the room.You want access to our award-winning journalism.You don’t want to be misled and misinformed.

A new administration in the US could upend its relations with old allies in Europe and intensify rivalry with China. In an uncertain world, India plays a leading role in maintaining balance. The global community is watching New Delhi’s efforts to restore stability to its troubled relationship with China, and wonders whether the Indo-US dynamic will recapture the energy that characterised it in Donald Trump’s first term. In spite of all this, the most consequential bilateral relationship in 2025 will be between India and Russia.The strength of ties between New Delhi and Moscow matters to both countries. It touches core mutual areas: Trade in energy, technological co-development, and strategic interests. Russia remains India’s most accommodating partner when it comes to high-tech supplies. While the West — France and the US in particular — are relaxing rules for trade with India in dual-use tech, there is still a long way to go before New Delhi’s undersea and long-range requirements are satisfied by the West. This is where Moscow steps in.What some overheated commentary on the India-Russia relationship misses is that it is of deep importance for the West as well. The BrahMos missile, co-developed by India and Russia, has been given to the Philippines to fend off the Chinese. In other words, it is only through India that Russian technology can be used to preserve the rules-based order. And it is only because it is India that no Chinese veto is permitted by Moscow on such sales.This is but one example of the unique nature of the relationship between India and Russia. Their closeness will have deeper implications in 2025, a year in which it will be recognised as a global public good. Here are five ways in which this relationship is vital for the preservation of global order.First, it serves as a bridge between the rest of the world and a Russian polity that has been alienated by, and has set out to further alienate, the Western ecosystem. India’s commitment to multilateralism and the global order anchors Russia, its close partner, to a system that it otherwise seeks to disrupt. India can do this because it is not seen as agitating for any one political or geopolitical position. It is a boundary nation that transcends systems, and provides an ability to connect — even integrate — separate universes.Second, the India-Russia relationship prevents the Russian bear from totally entering the dragon’s den. A Russia locked into servitude to Beijing’s interests would be profoundly inimical for the world order, the West in particular. India’s outstretched hand grants Russia the ability to manoeuvre and allows it to avoid capitulating completely to China’s demands. It has become increasingly clear — at BRICS and elsewhere — that avoiding becoming a junior partner to its giant neighbour is a priority for Moscow. Russia expects a partnership of equals. India provides one, China does not. Europe must realise that when peace eventually returns to the continent, it will be with Russia as an equal of the European Union, and not subordinate to it.Third, trade between India and Russia in fossil fuels is designed to be compliant with sanctions meant to limit Russian profits. This too provides broader benefits to the world. It brings valuable price stability and predictability to energy markets, which is vital for the West and for Europe in particular. It is no exaggeration to say that the energy trade component of the Indo-Russian relationship prevents Europe from slipping further into political disorder.Fourth, the relationship allows for new possibilities in the crucial Arctic region. Without India’s increasing strategic presence in the Arctic, in partnership not just with Russia but also with European and Nordic friends, a new Russia-China axis would have shaped the region’s future. This would have spelt disaster for the ecology and security of global supply chains. India’s growing role instead opens better options. A Chennai-Vladivostok corridor, co-owned by Russia and India, might be a first step towards a more effective and inclusive connectivity and governance architecture for the region.Finally, India’s presence in groupings with growing power and influence like BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ensures that these are not weaponised against the West. As External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has put it, India is non-Western, it is not anti-Western. This moderate and reasonable attitude shapes the actions and positions of such groupings. The entry of New Delhi’s candidates — and Western friends — such as the UAE, Egypt and Vietnam into BRICS as either members or partners has further moderated that grouping. The presence of these countries, and India’s leadership, ensures BRICS serves more as a complement to legacy, Western-led multilateral groupings than as a challenge.The ability to partner with nations that are deeply divided by geopolitics has been a feature of Indian diplomacy since Independence. It is only now, however, that this ability will be revealed as essential to prevent the fracturing of a stressed global order. The India-Russia relationship serves not just the two countries in question, but the world. The policy community in both India and the West is keenly aware of this relationship’s pivotal importance. Scepticism in the West’s Russophobic media and think tank ecosystem does not change that reality.The writer is president, Observer Research FoundationYou want to be the smartest in the room.You want access to our award-winning journalism.You don’t want to be misled and misinformed.This No Is Already Registered.Thanks For Registered Mobile No."}},{"headline":"ExplainedThe case against Dominique Pelicot, man convicted of ‘mass rape’ of his wife","pic":"//images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/2024-12-19T130227Z_460221913_RC2DSBAC0WVM_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-JUSTICE.jpg?w=210","link":"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/france-rape-case-pelicot-9734893/","contents":{"image":"https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/12/2024-12-19T130227Z_460221913_RC2DSBAC0WVM_RTRMADP_3_FRANCE-JUSTICE.jpg?w=640","text":"France Mass Rape Trial: In a case that shocked the world when it came to light earlier this year, Frenchman Dominique Pelicot was on Thursday (December 19) sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment for drugging and raping his wife, and inviting more than 70 other men to do so over a decade.Men varying from each other in terms of their age, occupation, race and background were reportedly invited by Dominique to sexually assault his wife Gisele in their home. She chose to forgo having her identity concealed to have a public trial, so that “shame swap sides”.Here is what to know about the case, what the court held and how it has shaped conversations around sexual abuse in France in recent months.Pelicot, 72, is a retired power company worker. He married Gisele in 1973 and they had three children together. According to a report in The New York Times, Gisele, 72, was the family’s main breadwinner early on, as a manager in a big public company. They also have grandchildren.He first came under the police’s radar in 2010, when he was caught filming up the skirts and dresses of women in a local market near Paris. He was arrested and fined for capturing “indecent images”, though Gisele said in court that she was not made aware of the incident back then.In 2011, he began drugging his wife, mixing substances in her food and beverages. She then began experiencing long periods when she thought she kept sleeping for no discernable reason. She was also unable to remember what she did the previous evening, and thought she had an Alzheimer’s-like illness.The couple retired in 2013 and moved to Mazan, a small town in south France. It is here that Dominique began soliciting strangers to come into their house after he drugged his wife, inviting them to rape her.Police found him to possess more than 20,000 photos and videos in all, in folders marked “abuse,” “her rapists,” “night alone” and other titles. However, the police discovered them only in 2020, when investigating Dominique for having filmed up the skirts of women in another market. His phone, memory card and other electronic devices were seized. That is when the extent of the abuse first dawned on the investigators and Gisele was called in.What happened during the trial?Dominique admitted to the charges against him and was held guilty on all counts. He was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment – the maximum possible under French law. According to the BBC, he was convicted of aggravated rape on his now former wife, of the attempted aggravated rape of the wife of one of the co-accused, and of taking indecent images of his daughter, as well as his two daughters-in-law.Through the videos and photos he captured, 50 of the 72 men involved in the crimes were identified and included in the trial. A majority of them denied the charges of rape, claiming they were unaware Gisele was drugged, or that they thought she consensually agreed to be drugged, or that they believed her husband had consented for her.All were held guilty, some of aggravated rape, and given sentences ranging between five to 13 years. They have 10 days to appeal the ruling.In a speech outside the court, Gisele said she respected the verdict and thanked her supporters, victims’ associations and others. “I have confidence in our capacity collectively to find a better future in which men and women alike can live harmoniously together with mutual respect,” she said.Ripples throughout FranceMany have asked “Why?”, expressing shock at the fact that abuse of such scale happened and went unnoticed for years. Given that there is no common thread linking these men, it has led to discussions on the role played by a larger, pervasive rape culture – how society in general justifies and normalises rape cases such that they are not treated as serious crimes.Take the story of the earliest person identified by police. A report from The Guardian notes: “…Adrien L, the privately educated son of a local businessman. He is alleged to have raped Gisèle in her bedroom in March 2014, when he was 23 and she was 62. His pregnant girlfriend gave birth to their son 10 days later. He told the court he had had a “hatred of women” since discovering that a daughter born to a previous girlfriend was not his biological child. He was jailed for 14 years after a separate trial earlier this year for rape and violence against three ex-girlfriends in 2017 and 2018. He denied raping Gisèle, telling investigators he thought it was a scenario the couple had agreed on and that “from the moment the husband was present, it wasn’t rape”. In court, he repeated his denial, saying he had not known Gisèle was drugged.”The case has resulted in women galvanising around Gisele, calling for a change in the country’s attitudes towards crimes against women. The typical idea of who a rapist can be, one who is an outsider, unknown and lurking in the shadows, has also been challenged. In a majority of cases globally, women experience violence and abuse at the hands of men they know.Some have also called for changes to the rape laws to improve the low conviction rates. The role of online platforms, including the unmoderated website that enabled Pelicot to message other men, has been brought into focus, too, raising concerns that such crimes could happen in any part of the world.(With AP inputs)You want to be the smartest in the room.You want access to our award-winning journalism.You don’t want to be misled and misinformed.NGT issues ultimatum to Kerala to remove illegally dumped biomedical and solid waste in Tamil Nadu, citing environmental hazards.

The court of Justice Manoj Jain, however, directed that a lien of Rs 105 be marked while unfreezing the account.“The impugned action, in essence, amounts to a violation of the fundamental right of the petitioner, as it directly undermines his right to livelihood, which is an integral part of the Right to Life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. Furthermore, when the investigating agency has identified a specific sum credited to the bank account of the petitioner, it is difficult to comprehend as to why the entire bank account of petitioner has been frozen,” the order dated December 17 read.“…the continued freezing of the entire bank account of the petitioner, without even hinting that the petitioner was either mastermind or accomplice in the cybercrime or knowingly received the funds as part of any illegal activity will not be justifiable and sustainable, at the moment,” it added.The bank allegedly froze the 44-year-old chhole bhature seller’s account following intimation from the concerned investigating agency — Anantapur IV Town Police Station, Ananthapuram, Andhra Pradesh. The police received a complaint on the UPI-related fraud on September 30. According to the bank, as per the police’s communication, only Rs 105 of the Rs 71,000 amassed through cyber fraud had landed in 44-year-old chhole bhature seller Pawan Kumar Rai’s account.But Rai says the hassle he went through over a mere Rs 105 is “unjustified”. “The banks should see the biodata of the account holder — what they do, how much money they have — before freezing it. I, too, have been a victim of cyber fraud in the past where I had mistakenly shared an OTP and had lost Rs 8,000 which was never recovered. But what to do, jo hogaya woh hogaya (what has happened has happened),” says Rai, who belongs to Jharkhand. He came to Delhi more than 25 years ago and set up his chhole bhature stall in Ashok Vihar.With UPI transactions of over Rs 3,000-4,000 per day, it was on October 1 he realised that he was unable to access or use his bank account for transactions. He learnt of the frozen account, which had a balance of over Rs 1.22 lakh, after a visit to the Rohini branch of the bank.Rai says he had no reason to suspect the credited amount as he assumed that some customer might have purchased chhole-bhature that he sells at Rs 35 per plate. A sale of three plates would have meant a UPI deposit of Rs 105.After repeated requests with the bank as well as the cyber crime police station in Sector 17 Rohini to unfreeze his account fell on deaf ears, a friend advised Rai to move the High Court.Represented by advocates Aditya Goel and Anil Goel, Rai argued before the High Court that “without giving any prior notice to him, his bank account could not have been attached,” and “the bank could have, at best, put a lien with respect to the aforesaid extent of Rs. 105/-, instead of freezing his entire account”. It was also argued that it is not clear whether the concerned investigating agency ever informed about the aforesaid seizure/freezing of the account to the concerned jurisdictional magistrate/court, which is mandated by law.Meanwhile, Rai, who visited his hometown during Dussehra, opened a postal bank account there so that his business transactions remain unaffected. “I have to pay off a loan that was linked to the frozen account. So when the account was frozen, that also stopped. I had to then make alternate arrangements where I would have to go physically to the bank and make the payments. That was a headache.

The sample represented about 37 per cent of the police force.In terms of health issues, Prakash said, “We found that gastrointestinal issues ranked first, followed by arthritis, hypertension, and diabetes.”“As for our focus area of gender-based violence, the survey showed that in 40 per cent of cases, the police officers blamed victims… Again in 40 per cent of cases, they asked irrelevant questions, and in 15 per cent of cases, the officers used foul language against complainants,” he said.According to NCRB data, more than 20,000 cases of violence against women were registered in Bihar in 2022. Of these cases, 40 per cent of women aged between 18 and 49 years experienced physical or sexual violence from their current partner.Considering all of this, to help the police better deal with such cases, experts designed a 21-hour curriculum.The training was imparted over three days for 25 officers each in shifts. This way, 1,405 officers, out of the 3,526 surveyed, were given training.The surveyors also spoke to 1,811 women constables, the wives of 217 officers, and 307 victims of gender-based violence over the last few months.Vandana Pandey, a theatre and art-based facilitator and founder of cultural organisation Rang Karwan, who has been part of several training sessions for police officers, said: “Rather than delivering mundane lectures, we applied theatre and expressive art in which police officers played the parts of police, society, and victims. At the end of each session, we would ask who is to blame. We would also try to highlight the social and moral aspects of policing.”“At the end of the three-day session, the police officers returned with the other side of stories — mainly the victims’ side. A sense of empathy towards complainants did develop in police officers after the end of training,” Pandey said.The experts involved in preparing the curriculum were Nisthith Prakash, Sophia Amaral of the World Bank, and Maria Micaela Sviatschi from Princeton University.Prakash said, “We have now found that about 65 per cent of police officers referred to a new handbook on dealing with gender-based violence.”A senior police officer at state headquarters said, “While such kind of innovative training would surely help police better understand women-related cases, the state government has also set an example by reserving 35 per cent seats in government jobs for women. As per 2020 data, Bihar had 25.3 per cent of women in its police force, surpassing Himachal Pradesh (19.5 per cent) and Tamil Nadu (18.5 per cent).”You want to be the smartest in the room.You want access to our award-winning journalism.You don’t want to be misled and misinformed.

The legendary filmmaker got the job done, but passed away not long afterwards. He was 87 years old. Clint Eastwood is even older; at 94, he just delivered what could be his final film, Juror No 2.Coincidentally another courtroom drama, the movie arrives over three decades after Eastwood entered the self-reflective phase of his career with the contemplative Western Unforgiven. In the last decade or so, he has devoted himself — as one would expect of a dying man — to understanding the idea of decency. Having made a name for himself in a genre famous for viewing the world in black and white, Eastwood has spent the better part of the last couple of decades dabbling in different shades of grey.Also read – Presumed Innocent review: Jake Gyllenhaal gives a predictably unpredictable performance in Apple’s legal thriller, it’s the perfect summer potboilerIn Gran Torino, the second-biggest hit of his career, he played an ornery old racist who becomes buddies with a bunch of Vietnamese immigrants. In The Mule, he played a guilt-ridden man who learns that it’s never too late to mend fences with loved ones. Both characters were forced to make tough moral choices. As is Justin Kemp, the protagonist of Juror No 2. Played by Nicholas Hoult, Justin is a recovering alcoholic who is called up for jury duty in a murder trial. He tries to wiggle out of it, using his pregnant wife as an excuse. But the judge assures him that she won’t keep him any longer than his job would. And so, Justin takes his seat alongside 11 of his peers, and together, they decide the fate of a man accused of killing his girlfriend in a fit of rage.The accused, James Sythe, was seen by numerous witnesses at the local bar one rainy night, having a loud argument with his girlfriend, Kendall. She walked away from him, and Justin appeared to follow in her direction. Kendall was found dead in a ravine the next day, her injuries consistent with blunt force trauma. An eyewitness swore that he saw James Sythe at the scene of the crime. As Justin listens to the arguments, he is struck senseless by a realisation. As it turns out, he was present at the bar that night as well, on the edge of a relapse. He drove home in the rain, and hit what he thought was a deer. That was the end of that. Or so he thought.Half-convinced that Kendall died because of his negligence, Justin tries to convince his fellow jury members to deliberate the case more patiently. For them, it’s an open and shut case. Plus, they have places to be, things to do. Is there really no room for doubt? Eastwood has always been skeptical about systems, but in Juror No 2, he seems to be suspicious of the people who hold such systems aloft. He doesn’t judge the other jurors for wanting to get it over with, however. It’s not like they’re deliberately sending an innocent man to prison. They don’t have the information that Justin does; they’re certain James Sythe is guilty.But Justin isn’t. He can’t implicate himself; he’d be convicted in a heartbeat, what with his prior history with alcohol abuse. And his conscience certainly won’t allow him to see James go to jail. Juror No 2 is a movie that asks every audience member to put themselves in the protagonist’s shoes. In revealing Justin’s morality, it reveals our own. Toni Collette plays the driven district attorney, who knows that getting a conviction in the case would only improve her reputation. Chris Messina plays the overworked public defender. But only a part of Juror No 2 takes place in the courtroom; the rest of it unfolds in the jury’s deliberation room.Read more – Carry-On movie review: Taron Egerton turns up the heat in Netflix’s terrific ticking timebomb thrillerEastwood allows his actors to do the heavy lifting, relying, as usual, on the spartan style that has gradually become his directorial trademark. The filmmaker is famous for delivering his films under-budget and on time. Paul Walter Hauser, who played the titular hero in Eastwood’s Richard Jewell, once told me that they would often wrap the day’s work by lunchtime. In Juror No 2, he urges the audience to spend time with the characters, not only when they’re discussing the finer details of the case, but also when they’re stewing in silence.He also wants to poke holes in the idea of institutions, especially those designed to serve and protect. He most recently examined these concepts in the film Sully, where a couple of heroic pilots were investigated for potential wrongdoing. Even American Sniper appeared to be outraged at the idea of a war hero’s reputation being sullied by the liberal left. Eastwood is, after all, a card-carrying Republican. But as dicey as his politics might be, he remains a deeply empathetic filmmaker.

It was a record-breaking night for India in Navi Mumbai on Thursday night as they beat West Indies by 60 runs in the T20I series decider. First, Mandhana broke the record for the most 50-plus scores in women’s T20Is. Once she was dismissed, Ghosh came in and smashed an 18-ball half-century, the joint-fastest ever in this format. And those two knocks powered India to 217/4, their highest-ever total in women’s T20Is.Hayley Matthews won the toss for a third straight time and had no hesitation to bowl first, given the dew factor at the DY Patil Stadium makes it a chase-friendly venue. The first over from Chinelle Henry saw the ball move around significantly and she picked up the wicket of Uma Chetry too, who was out for a duck. India paid the price for not being able to start well in the 2nd match of the series but stand-in captain Mandhana quickly found the feet.Mandhana got going with a boundary in the second over through the offside but her onslaught truly began in the third. First, she took on Chinelle Henry, hitting three successive fours. She then followed that up with 4, 6, 4, 4 after getting back on strike in Deandra Dottin’s over, scoring seven boundaries on the trot. It was a dream start for Mandhana and India.At the other end, Jemimah Rodrigues took her time to get set but helped India finish the powerplay strongly (61/1) with three fours in Karishma Ramharack’s over. The pleasing aspect of India’s batting was also how it wasn’t just a Mandhana show. Once Rodrigues fell for a busy 39, newcomer Raghvi Bist didn’t waste any time to get going, smashing her first international six off the 6th ball she faced.Mandhana added another feather to her cap in what has been a good year for her personally. Her third consecutive half century of the series was the 30th in her career and it took her past New Zealand legend Suzie Bates, who has 28 half-centuries and one century in the format. The left-hander got to the landmark with a four over midwicket, scoring a 27-ball half century. Her first century in this format looked imminent until she got out rather softly by lofting Dottin to the fielder at mid off.A 60-run victory in the Third and Final T20I! 🥳#TeamIndia win the decider in style and complete a 2⃣-1⃣ series victory 👏👏Scorecard ▶️ https://t.co/Fuqs85UJ9W#INDvWI | @IDFCFIRSTBank pic.twitter.com/SOPTWMPB3E— BCCI Women (@BCCIWomen) December 19, 2024But in came Ghosh in the 15th over, and continuing the trend up until then, didn’t take long to fire. She smashed the first ball for a straight six off Dottin, followed that up with a square cut for four and it set the tone for what was to follow. However, West Indies did give her a big reprieve in the next over, with Dottin and Henry getting in each other’s way at deep midwicket and it proved to be rather costly. Ghosh could have actually set the outright record for the fastest 50 but failed to connect properly with a short ball when on 44 off 16. But off the first ball of the last over, she reached the record-equalling milestone with a six over midwicket. And once she fell, Sajana Sajeevan came in to hit a first-ball boundary to take India to their best total in this format. “First ball or last ball, if it is in my slot, I want to go for the big shots,” Ghosh said after the match.The target of 218 was going to be daunting but WI showed last year they can achieve it, when they pulled off a win in Australia. A lot depended on Matthews and Dottin, and India were able to dismiss both of them in the 20s after getting starts.“The way Raghvi batted was impressive, she came out with a lot of intent,” Mandhana said. “Playing just a second match and hitting 4th or 5th ball for a six… I think I would have not been able to do that when I was playing my second match. Then I think the way Richa took that responsibility was superb. Even in the last match I think her innings was really amazing but we could not appreciate it because we could not win the match. But today, I was just telling her I don’t know what did she eat today.”The win marked a T20I series victory at home for the first time in 5 years for India. As Mandhana said, it was something that spurred the team on. “When I saw that stat, it is not something which reflects on what kind of cricket we’ve played so that’s what the chat was in the morning… that today we have an opportunity to change that, so really happy that you know we’ve got this series win.”217/4: Highest total for India in WT20Is\n18 balls: Fastest T20I fifty by an Indian woman and joint-fastest overall\n30: Smriti Mandhana surpassed Suzie Bates for the most fifty-plus scores in women’s T20IsYou want to be the smartest in the room.You want access to our award-winning journalism.You don’t want to be misled and misinformed.

In the initial burst of fire, two soldiers were injured.According to officials, the joint team of forces returned fire, leading to a gunfight in which the five militants were killed. All the slain militants were from Kulgam district, officials said.In a post on X, the J&K Police said, “Five terrorists neutralised in Kulgam anti-terrorist operation.” The post added that search operations were continuing.Officials later confirmed that one of the dead was Hizbul commander Bhat (44), alias Umer, alias Farooq Nali. From Yaripora in Kulgam, Bhat had joined the militant ranks in 2015 and went on to become the longest-surviving militant in the Valley. His name figured in the most-wanted militants’ list in 2021 and was categorised as an ‘A +’ militant in police records.The other slain militants were identified as Mushtaq Ahmad Itoo, Adil Hussain, Yasir Javid and Mohammad Irfan. A resident of Mohammadpur village in Kulgam, Itoo had joined the Hizbul Mujahideen in March 2020. Hussain, a resident of Khandipora village, had been an active militant for over a year, while Irfan, a resident of Hawoorah, had joined the militant ranks in 2022. Javid had joined the militants this year.Police officers said they recovered multiple identity cards from the slain militants, including Aadhaar cards, voter identity cards and ATM cards.This is the second major gunfight in Kulgam this year.

The bench instructed Kerala to either retrieve the waste or enter into an agreement with Tamil Nadu’s Common Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility for safe disposal.“Kerala should take back the waste or formalise a Memorandum of Understanding for its scientific disposal without delay,” the order said. Tamil Nadu’s government pleader, D Shanmuganathan, informed the bench that Kerala had failed to honour a previous June 2024 directive to pay Rs 69,000 for cleanup efforts in Nanguneri, where similar dumping had occurred.The illegal dumping of biomedical waste, reportedly sourced from hospitals and municipal establishments in Kerala, has sparked outrage. Truckloads of hazardous materials have been found abandoned in water bodies, farmlands, and forests in Tirunelveli district. The NGT initiated a suo motu case following investigative reports highlighting the environmental hazards posed by these practices.Local activists allege that unauthorised waste collectors transport the waste under the cover of darkness, evading border checks. Tamil Nadu officials are conducting assessments to quantify the volume of waste dumped across multiple sites, including Kodaganallur, Palavoor, Kondanagaram, and Sivalarkulam.FIRs have been lodged with the Suthamalli police against the entities responsible, invoking Sections 271 and 272 of the Indian Penal Code, alongside provisions of the Environment Protection Act.This is not the first instance of Kerala’s waste being dumped in Tamil Nadu. Past incidents in Nanguneri, Theni, and Anamalai have drawn sharp criticism.“Despite judicial orders and public protest, Tamil Nadu’s border districts continue to bear the brunt of these violations,” said a senior official of Tamil Nadu’s Pollution Control Board (TNPCB).Kerala’s Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) has admitted lapses. Advocate V K Rema Smrithi, representing KSPCB, told the tribunal, “Some unauthorised waste collectors, not recognised by the government, were indulging in this illegality.” The tribunal responded by demanding stringent action against these operators.The crisis has also triggered political reactions. Tamil Nadu BJP president K Annamalai accused the DMK government of failing to safeguard the state’s environmental and territorial integrity. Annamalai said southern districts, particularly Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, and Tenkasi, have become the dump yards of the Kerala government. “Biomedical waste, plastic waste, and poultry waste are being illegally dumped in Tamil Nadu, and checkposts have turned into collection centres,” he said, alleging collusion at the highest levels.Annamalai warned of mass protests and threatened to march to Kerala to return the waste if the situation persists.According to the Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016, such materials must be treated in dedicated facilities to prevent contamination.You want to be the smartest in the room.You want access to our award-winning journalism.You don’t want to be misled and misinformed.Ambedkarite student organisations protested at Savitribai Phule Pune University, demanding a full-time registrar, a drugs-free campus, better security, and action against discrimination faced by Dalit, Adivasi and Bahujan students.

I always eat in a bowl. Because I know how much I need to eat. I know that’s the amount of food I need to consume and not more than that,” the 51-year-old told CurlyTales.During the conversation, she also shed light on her food and fitness habits. From drinking various water-based shots in the morning to yoga, Arora said she doesn’t change her routine much. “My water therapy is almost 45 minutes to 1 hour, which varies. I have my turmeric, ginger, cumin-carom seeds water, and hot water, and lime. So, I start off with these and then eat something as a proper meal,” added Arora.Her breakfast choices are varied but always “good, solid.” “It can be anything from eggs to poha to dosa, idli, paratha. I have a solid breakfast which is very important. My last meal is at 7. I finish dinner by then and I eat nothing until the next day,” said Arora.She also ensures to include carbohydrates in lunch. “I always need some carbohydrates in my meals. I balance it out across meals. Otherwise, I feel very dull. I feel that I cannot work late hours or be my optimum. I could have khichdi at night, a wholesome meal with vegetables,” said Arora.Taking a cue from her candid admission, let’s understand if eating in a bowl is a good practice.Dt Neha Pathania, chief dietician, Paras Hospital, Gurgaon, said that setting out a bowl does help control your portions as long as it contains a balanced diet.“This way, food becomes a source of nourishment, not a way to seek emotional comfort,” said Pathania.Due to its smaller surface area, a bowl naturally limits portion sizes, helping with better portion control and reducing the likelihood of overeating. “This can be particularly helpful for managing calorie intake and maintaining a balanced diet,” said Dr Maneendra, consultant and HOD critical care department, Gleneagles Hospitals, Lakdi Ka Pul, Hyderabad.From a psychological perspective, Dr Maneendra noted that eating from a bowl encourages a more mindful eating experience. “Holding a bowl often requires using both hands, fostering a connection with the food and slowing down the eating process. This can improve digestion and allow the brain to register fullness, reducing the risk of overeating. Moreover, bowls are ideal for meals that combine multiple ingredients, such as salads, soups, or grain bowls, ensuring a balanced mix of nutrients,” said Dr Maneendra.Eat low-calorie, nutritious foods, such as fruits and vegetables. “Vegetables and fruits are good sources of vitamins and minerals; they are also low in calories and rich in dietary fibre. Vegetables and fruits, like other vegetables or plant-based foods, contain substances that may help prevent heart disease. It would be best if you also had carbohydrates, protein and fats in your diet,” said Pathania.While these benefits are not universal, they reflect small, positive changes that can contribute to healthier eating habits. “However, the choice between a bowl and a plate ultimately depends on personal preference, meal type, and individual dietary needs,” said Dr Maneendra.DISCLAIMER: This article is based on information from the public domain and/or the experts we spoke to.

Sadly, most of this time has been wasted in disruption. For many of us, the only constructive work was done in the Parliamentary committees. But the main Parliament did not fulfill its duty to the nation. I think we have let the people of India down. Very unfortunate,\" he said.\"To my mind, Parliament is a forum for debate, discussion, disagreements certainly but not for disruption. There was an agreement reached between the Government and Opposition in the first week that the Opposition can protest outside but inside work would continue. It went on for 2-3 days. But thereafter, we ended up once again with a complete breakdown...I think that was very unfortunate. I really hope that the Govt reaches out to the Opposition and finds a solution,\" Tharoor told ANI.Rajya Sabha proceedings have also been adjourned sine die as the Parliament winter session came to an today. Rajya Sabha proceedings have presumed with chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar residing over the session. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said that Congress should apologise for their protest against Home minister Amit Shah over his Rajya Sabha speech.\"BJP has already clearly stated their history.

Both Houses will be adjourned sine die today...NDA MPs are very agitated over the conduct of Rahul Gandhi yesterday. He insulted one of the MPs from Nagaland and then injured two other MPs.

It is scared of having any discussion. They know that their true sentiments for Ambedkar ji have come out. So, they are now scared of the Opposition because we are raising this issue. National interest is related to this matter. Our Constitution has been given by Ambedkar ji, people of this country and our freedom struggle. Such insult to him will not be tolerated by India.\"BJP MP Arun Govil said that whatever is happening in the Parliament is not good for their image.\"This is tarnishing the image of Parliament. It seems we need a lot of discipline and the opposition needs a lot of restraint.

I fell and had slight injuries also...To distract attention from the burning issue of insulting Babasaheb Ambedkar, the BJP is coming with a new version that a woman was attacked by Rahul Gandhi,\" he told ANI.Kumar further said, \"This is completely baseless and we challenge the concerned authorities to make the video footage available in the public domain. We have an excellent CCTV camera system.

Samajwadi Party MP Dimple Yadav, protesting with other INDIA bloc leaders at Vijay Chowk, told reporters that they want the BJP MPs to apologise for insulting Dr BR Ambedkar.Reacting to the Congress' complaint over Thursday's row in the Parliment, Yadav further said, \"BJP goes ahead with just one side. It never goes ahead with India's Constitution, democracy and its people. I think BJP should apologise for tomorrow' face off because only the BJP Govt and BJP MPs are responsible for it.\"Citing sources, news agency ANI reported that Parliament case enquiry and investigation of both the BJP and the Congress' case will be transferred to the Crime Branch.In the BJP complaint, an FIR has already been registered against Lok Sabha Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi.NDA MPs are also demonstrating on the Parliament premises against the Congress party, alleging that the grand old party disrespected BR Ambedkar.As INDIA bloc MPs protest against Amit Shah's Ambedkar remarks at Vijay Chowk, Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi told reporters, \"The entire country is watching, they have slapped several cases on Rahul Gandhi.

Yesterday Varsha Gaikwad also gave a complaint but there is no FIR. The FIR is only for BJP's complaint?\" Venugopal asked while speaking to ANI.MPs of INDIA bloc were protesting on Friday at Vijay Chowk over Union Home Minister Amit Shah's remark on Dr BR Ambedkar in Rajya Sabha, and demand his apology and resignation.  Congress MP Pramod Tiwari said that BJP's \"fascist ideology\" came to the fore on Thursday.\"The way they have disrespected Ambedkar ji very shamelessly, I would say, the way they have insulted him, these people got infuriated by this and stood in the main entrance of the parliament with banners and posters on sticks. Hundreds of them stood there. And when our women members started going inside, our elderly Mallikarjun Kharge, also fell down. I saw this for the first time in my life,\" Tiwari told ANI.BJP MP Nishikant Dubey has submitted a breach of privilege notice against the Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha to Speaker Om Birla, accusing him of showing \"criminally edited\" speech of Home minister Amit Shah.In his notice, Dubey has alleged that Gandhi exhibited yet another case of \"political bankruptcy\" by sharing on social media, especially X, the \"edited\" version of Shah's speech in the Rajya Sabha.Congress MP Manickam Tagore on Friday submitted an adjournment motion notice in the Lok Sabha to discuss Union home minister Amit Shah's remarks on Dr BR Ambedkar and demanded his apology along with resignation.\"The Minister's comments, made during the Constitution debate in the Rajya Sabha, were not only unacceptable but also reflected a deep-seated disdain for the principles of social justice and equality that Dr Ambedkar fought for throughout his life,\" Manickam Tagore said in the notice.He demanded that Shah apologise unconditionally for his remarks and resign as the Union home minister.The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on 'One Nation One Election' bill will have 39 members, a PTI report said.The list of Lok Sabha MPs proposed by the government now includes one member each from the Shiv Sena (UBT), CPI(M) and the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), besides two more members of the BJP and one more of the Samajwadi party.The list of business for Friday also includes a motion from Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal to refer the two constitutional amendment bills to a joint committee, including 27 members from the Lok Sabha and 12 from the Rajya Sabha.It is a doubt whether leaders of the opposition and ruling alliance will hold demonstrations in the Parliament on Friday as Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla imposed a strict ban on the same the day before.Birla's decision came after a scuffle in the Parliament resulted in two BJP MPs being seriously injured.Ahead of the resumption of the Parliament session, the Bharatiya Janata Party has moved a privilege notice against Rahul Gandhi. The Congress on Friday slammed the FIR registered against Rahul Gandhi in connection with the scuffle in the Parliament that seriously injured two BJP MPs.

Get features likeThe Republican-led House rejected a temporary funding plan backed by President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday with just over 24 hours to go before a US government shutdown.Trump had pressured GOP lawmakers to abandon an earlier bipartisan deal and insisted Republican leaders add a provision waiving or raising the federal debt limit before he takes office.The bill failed by a vote of 235 to 174, with more than 30 Republicans voting with nearly all Democrats against the spending package, which would have also suspended the debt ceiling for two years.Lawmakers in the United States racing against time to avert a government shutdown, with Democrats and Republicans unable to reach a consensus on the federal debt ceiling. With just over 24 hours left before government funding lapses, the Republican-led House of Representatives on Thursday rejected a temporary funding proposal supported by President-elect Donald Trump, throwing the nation’s finances into uncertainty. Here’s a breakdown of the current situation and the role the debt ceiling plays in this crisis.The debt ceiling, or debt limit, is a cap set by Congress on the amount of money the federal government can borrow to meet its existing legal obligations. This includes paying for past spending on things like Social Security, Medicare, and national security. The US government’s debt currently stands at approximately $36 trillion, and as borrowing costs rise—partly due to inflation and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic—the government faces increased pressure to raise the debt ceiling to continue funding its obligations.The most recent increase to the debt ceiling occurred in June 2023, when lawmakers suspended the debt limit until January 1, 2025. When this suspension expires, the debt limit will automatically rise to match the amount of debt the Treasury Department has already issued.Raising or suspending the debt ceiling is not a decision about new spending but rather a mechanism that allows the government to fulfil its existing financial commitments. However, this technical issue has become a political battleground, often used by both parties to push for broader fiscal priorities.President-elect Donald Trump has demanded that a provision raising or suspending the nation's debt limit be included in legislation to avert a government shutdown. Trump's insistence has led to a standoff with lawmakers, who are struggling to find a solution.The debt ceiling debate has significant implications for the US economy. Failing to raise the debt limit could lead to a catastrophic default on the nation's debts, causing widespread economic disruption.Although there's no immediate need to raise the debt limit, the Treasury Department can employ \"extraordinary measures\" to avoid default. However, these measures are temporary and may only delay the default deadline until summer 2025.Historically, lawmakers have always raised the debt ceiling in time, recognising the severe consequences of inaction. Failure to do so would result in the government being unable to meet its legal financial obligations, which could lead to significant disruptions in services, delayed payments, and a loss of confidence in US financial stability.The debt ceiling fight poses a significant challenge for Speaker Mike Johnson, who is seeking to retain his position in the new Congress. Trump's demands have put Johnson in a difficult spot, and the outcome of this dispute may impact his future as Speaker.Democrats have rejected the Republican proposal, with Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries dismissing the plan as \"laughable.\" Jeffries argues that Republicans should honour the earlier spending agreement, rather than attempting to raise the debt ceiling.As the deadline for government funding approaches, lawmakers must find a solution to the debt ceiling dispute. The consequences of failure could be severe, and the nation waits with bated breath to see how this crisis will be resolved.One of the most vocal critics of the proposed plan was Representative Chip Roy, a conservative from Texas, who decried the extension of the debt ceiling as reckless. \"To congratulate yourself because it’s shorter in pages but increases the debt by $5 trillion is asinine,\" Roy said, highlighting the party’s internal struggle over fiscal discipline.Further complicating matters, Elon Musk - Trump’s adviser and the world’s richest man - also weighed in. Through a series of social media posts, Musk condemned the earlier deal as a \"giveaway for billionaires\" and urged Republicans to oppose the bill. His criticism was potent, with Trump himself taking Musk’s advice on board and pressuring lawmakers to align with his vision for fiscal policy.Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who had been working behind closed doors to find a compromise, is now facing intense pressure. Trump, who has been involved in negotiating government funding, warned that Republicans who fail to take action on the debt ceiling could face political repercussions. This sets up a high-stakes moment for Johnson, who must now navigate these complex political waters just before the holiday season."}},{"headline":"Supreme Court upholds decision to scrap toll collection on DND Flyway","pic":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/20/150x84/Traffic-on-the-Delhi-Noida-Delhi-Flyway---Sunil-Gh_1734674655977.jpg","summary":"The SC found that NTBCL had already recovered both the cost of constructing the flyway and a reasonable profit since the expressway opened in 2001.","link":"/cities/delhi-news/supreme-court-upholds-decision-to-scrap-toll-collection-on-dnd-flyway-101734674659671.html","contents":{"image":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/20/550x309/Traffic-on-the-Delhi-Noida-Delhi-Flyway---Sunil-Gh_1734674655977.jpg","text":"Subscribe Now! Get features likeIn a major relief for commuters using the Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) flyway, the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a decision barring the collection of toll charges, reprimanding the Noida Authority for enabling a toll company to exploit commuters indefinitely.A bench comprising justices Surya Kant and Ujjal Bhuyan affirmed the 2016 judgment of the Allahabad high court, which directed the Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd (NTBCL) to cease toll collection from vehicles using the DND flyway, which connects Delhi with Noida.The Supreme Court found that NTBCL had already recovered both the cost of constructing the flyway and a reasonable profit since the expressway opened in 2001.Criticising the Noida Authority, the bench noted that the agreement with NTBCL lacked a defined time frame for toll collection, effectively allowing the concessionaire to charge users perpetually.“NOIDA overstepped its authority be delegating powers to NTBCL to collect or levy fees, and the arrangement was alien to terms of concessionaire agreement...it has resulted in undue burden on users,” said justice Kant while reading out the operative part of the judgment.The bench added that general public has already parted with several hundreds of crores and that there is no reason for the collection of user or toll fee to continue. The court also validated the public interest litigation (PIL) filed in 2012 by the Federation of Noida Residents’ Welfare Associations, which challenged the “levy and collection of toll in the name of user fee” by NTBCL. The bench concluded that the PIL was legally sound and rightly adjudicated by the high court.Highlighting a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), the top court further observed that NTBCL had achieved adequate profit through toll collection, reinforcing the finding that further toll collection was unjustified. Consequently, the Supreme Court dismissed NTBCL’s appeal against the High Court’s judgment.The DND flyway, operational since 2001, has significantly reduced travel time between Delhi and Noida, easing traffic congestion in the region. Prior to the high court judgment, commuters were charged ₹28 per trip or ₹56 for a round trip for using the expressway, which was touted as a smoother and faster route within the Delhi-NCR region.The verdict is expected to benefit thousands of daily commuters by eliminating a recurring financial burden while ensuring the principle of fairness in public infrastructure projects."}},{"headline":"Mumbai boat tragedy: Survivor claims Navy boat driver was 'showing off'","pic":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/20/148x111/mumbai_boat_1734656741995_1734656742287.jpg","summary":"Contesting Navy's claim of \"engine failure\" in speedboat leading to the crash, the survivor said the vessel's driver was in a playful mood and was showing off.","link":"/india-news/mumbai-boat-tragedy-survivor-claims-navy-boat-driver-was-showing-off-contests-claims-of-engine-failure-101734655858383.html","contents":{"text":"Subscribe Now!

In those tough conditions, the Indian team was expected to be more competitive. Kohli helped India to a first series win in Australia in 2018-19, but the lead-up to that was a difficult one as they lost in England 1-4 in the summer of 2018.Actor Varun Dhawan provided a look into the psyche of Kohli during that series, reflecting on what he had heard about the then-Indian captain’s reaction to the difficulty of that 2018 series from Kohli’s wife, actor Anushka Sharma.Speaking on Ranveer Allahbadia’s podcast, ‘The Ranveer Show’, Dhawan explained: “Virat, I mean, everything he’s been through, the times he’s not been in good form, some insights that Anushka shared with me, about his mindset.”“I think it was a Nottingham Test,” added Dhawan. “Where India had lost, and she said she didn’t attend that game that day. She came back, she didn’t know where Virat was, and she came to the room and saw him laid down, literally crying.”While Dhawan likely got his Test matches mixed up, with the Trent Bridge match being the only one of the series India won, the difficulty of the other losses remained. Dhawan continued: “How he took the whole thing on himself, like I failed, when he was still the highest scorer that day. He was the captain of the side.”Dhawan, who starred with Anushka Sharma in the 2018 film Sui Dhaaga before her hiatus from Bollywood over the last few years, is likely remembering the Edgbaston Test in Birmingham that opened that series. Kohli scored 149 in the first innings and followed that up with a top-scoring 51 in the chase, where India fell agonisingly short by 31 runs.Kohli would go on to have success in England during the 2021 tour, where he helped India to a 2-1 lead in the first four Test matches of the series with memorable wins at the Oval and in Lord’s. However, the final match of that series was postponed due to a Covid outbreak, and by the time India returned to England to complete that match, Kohli had been asked to step aside as captain. India went on to suffer a loss and leave England with a drawn series in the record books.Kohli will return to action for India in the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, having gotten away with a rain-affected draw at the Gabba to leave the series level at 1-1 after three Tests."}},{"headline":"Delhi CEO takes a dig at Bengaluru’s Kannada language issue in hiring post","pic":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/20/148x111/GfIqHQ1bgAAbTXa_1734660419389_1734660440497.jpg","summary":"Delhi NCR-based CEO Vikram Chopra has sparked a controversy with his hiring post that took a dig at Bengaluru’s language issue.","link":"/trending/delhi-ceo-vikram-chopra-of-cars24-takes-a-dig-at-bengaluru-s-kannada-language-issue-in-hiring-post-101734660217159.html","contents":{"image":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/20/550x309/GfIqHQ1bgAAbTXa_1734660419389_1734660440497.jpg","text":"Subscribe Now!

Earlier, Kapil Dev had reacted to Ashwin's retirement, saying the spinner did not get the farewell he deserved. “The next generation has to be better than us. If not, the world is not going ahead. We never imagined that somebody would come close to Sachin Tendulkar or Sunil Gavaskar...Ashwin has gone. I wish I had been there, I wouldn't have let him go like that.

It is important to state that Ashwin landed in Chennai on Thursday morning. He received a hero's welcome at his home.Soon after, Ashwin's father gave an interview to an outlet, saying Ashwin might have retired after feeling ‘humiliated’. The former India spinner also took to X to urge people not to take his father's comments seriously as he is not “media-trained”. He also asked journalists to leave his dad “alone.\"Since Ashwin retired from international cricket, the premier off-spinner has received glowing tributes from former and current cricketers. Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Gautam Gambhir also posted heartfelt messages for the 38-year-old. Ashwin called time on his international career, finishing as one of the biggest match-winners the country has ever produced. He is second only to Anil Kumble in wicket-taking charts for Indian bowlers.Ashwin, who is known for adding new tricks to his sleeve, is currently the highest-taking off-spinner in Tests. However, Australia's Nathan Lyon will soon break his record.The off-spinner has the most number of Player of Series Awards (11) when it comes to men's Test cricket.Along with 537 Test wickets, Ashwin also has 6 hundreds in the longest format. Quite often in the past, he has bailed the team out of difficult situations with the bat, with the most recent occasion being the Test match against Bangladesh in Chennai, where he scored a hundred.Ashwin was also a part of the 2011 ODI World Cup and 2013 Champions Trophy winning squads. He won the ICC Cricketer of the Year and ICC Men's Test Cricket of the Year awards in 2016.

However, uncertainty remains regarding who will captain the side come IPL 2025.RCB Team Director Mo Bobat has now revealed what Virat Kohli had to say about the squad the team managed to assemble in the auction. On Day 1 of the auction, Robin Uthappa and Eoin Morgan criticised RCB's strategy, as the duo expressed shock that the franchise did not go all the way to get the likes of KL Rahul or Rishabh Pant.\"He's someone I have spoken to regularly since the end of the [2024] season.

That fed quite easily into our retentions. Even on auction days [he was] interacting with us at the table, in particular interacting with DK,\" he added.RCB has yet to win the IPL title even once. The team came close in 2016 when they reached the final; however, Virat Kohli and Co, had to endure a heartbreaking loss against SunRisers Hyderabad. Time and again, the franchise has faced criticism for not assembling a good enough squad at the auction. In the past few years, RCB has managed to put together a solid top three in terms of batting; however, they have been found out in the bowling department.Short boundaries at M Chinnaswamy Stadium and a lack of quality bowlers have led to RCB's inability to have a significant home advantage in Bengaluru.\"Winning the IPL is our target, but the way we play is our obsession. We want to get our competitive identity, and if we do that, it'll take care of itself. Now, the proof will be in the pudding. We'll find out when we get into the competition, but if you want a different outcome, you've got to have a different approach,\" said Mo Bobat.\"I love playing at the Chinnaswamy. For me, that just adds to the intrigue: can we do it with that constraint? It's exciting,\" he added.Speaking about picking up Hazlewood and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, the RCB Team Director said, \"Given what I said about our reflections of last year, of us wanting to be able to take wickets, particularly early on to get ahead of the game, having bowlers that are highly skilled through all phases is really important, particularly with the new ball, and of course, at the death.\"\"And also having the experience and the resilience to deal with the pressure that comes with bowling at the Chinnaswamy.

The 38-year-old off-spinner called time on his prolific career, finishing India's second-highest wicket-taker in Tests. Ashwin's announcement came out of the blue and shocked several fans and cricket pundits.Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has now paid a special tribute to Ashwin, saying his quality to keep evolving made him truly special. Throughout his career, Ashwin has been known as a cricket geek. The off-spinner eventually took 765 wickets across all formats of the game.“I think what stands out for me was his wanting to evolve all the time. He wasn't the kind of guy satisfied as to where he started,\" Shastri told ICC Review.“He wanted new tricks to be learned. He pursued it, practiced hard at it and continued to look for new things as his career progressed, to keep up with the times,” he added.Ashwin's international wickets are only second to Anil Kumble's (953) among Indian bowlers. Shastri hailed Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja's bowling partnership, calling them the spin twins.“And for him to do it in his span and the way he has done it, especially when it came to bowling in the last four or five years, I think in India, along with (Ravindra) Jadeja, I think they were a terrific pair, the real spin twins,\" Shastri said.Former India head coach Shastri, who oversaw India's two series wins in Australia in 2018-19 and 2020-21, also spoke about how Ashwin's pairing with Jadeja helped the duo in their quest for wickets. “They complemented each other well, and they spurred each other on, you know, so I would say a lot of Jadeja's wickets in the last, you know, five-six years have come because of Ashwin and vice-versa,\" Shastri said.In his Test career, Ashwin dismissed 269 right-handed batter wickets and 268 left-handed batter wickets. Shastri said that these stats prove that Ashwin was all quality, irrespective of the opponent and playing style.“For me, it was his guile, wanting to excel in his craft and (especially) in the last two-three years, the way he got the ball to the way, gave it a rip and got it to dip on the batsman with drift made him stand out,\" Shastri said.“And you look at his record against right-handers, against left-handers, it's pretty much similar, you know, which says it all. It didn't matter to him who he was bowling against.

Get features likeRavichandran Ashwin, 38, shocked the world when he announced his retirement following the conclusion of the third Test between India and Australia at the Gabba, Brisbane. The second-highest wicket-taker for India across formats, Ashwin did not mince his words, saying he still has \"punch\" left in him as a cricketer, but his time as an Indian international cricketer is up. The off-spinner brought the curtain down on an illustrious career after scalping 765 wickets, 537 of those in Test cricket.Since the beginning of his career, Ashwin has been an ardent student of the game, always wanting to grow and add more tricks up his sleeve. WV Raman knows Ashwin better than most. He was the coach of Tamil Nadu when Ashwin made his First-Class debut. In an interaction with Hindustan Times, Raman spoke about what made Ashwin a special talent from the very start.\"It must have come as a surprise. Obviously, it was not something hinted at any time in the preceding weeks. However, what happens is that no cricketer can predict when it's enough. That's something nobody knows. Because one fine morning, you wake up, you suddenly decide that 'enough is enough'. You can't do the same thing again and again,\" said Raman.\"If you just lose it mentally, that's about it. And that's something nobody can predict when it can happen.\"Contrary to the general belief that Ashwin burst onto the scene through his Indian Premier League (IPL) gig with Chennai Super Kings (CSK), but in truth, the off-spinner had been putting in the hard yards from years prior, when he made his First-Class debut in 2006 against Haryana at 20.\"You can never say that X will go on to do such and such thing or come out with such numbers when he calls it quits. You just say that he's got talent, the attitude and all things aligning properly, you would think that X might have a very bright future. So that is something that struck me after the first couple of seasons that I saw him for Tamil Nadu. And as it turned out, he's had a fantastic career. He's made a fantastic career out of cricket,\" said Raman.Ashwin took more than 380 wickets on Indian soil. Over the years, several naysayers have thrown brickbats at the off-spinner, saying he manages to scalp wickets in bulk because of the rank turners Indian pitches have had to offer. However, Raman rightly so points out that the argument is highly flawed.\"I don't think it's a reasonable line to say. When we can appreciate batters getting hundreds on good batting tracks, why can't we appreciate five-wicket hauls on turning ones? The fact that somebody is walking into the sunset after having picked up 700-plus wickets, he's finished as the second-highest wicket-taker for the country, he's rated as one of the all-time greats in cricket across the world. What more do you need? The point is that in anybody's career, there will always be areas where you can sit back and try to split it into thin hair. But it's of no use at this point, isn't it?\" said Raman.If one has followed Ashwin's career closely, he/she would know that the off-spinner who finishes with 765 international wickets is an astute operator and is always in search of answers. Ashwin has repeatedly added more weapons to his arsenal to gain an advantage over batters.\"He was the most naturally gifted, talented cricketer you'd see. But in terms of maximising one's potential, I think he's done that. He's shown how it can be done, and he's punched above his weight. For the simple reason, he had to overcome a lot of challenges, and he's done a phenomenal job of it,\" said Raman.Were there times when Ashwin was not on the same page as WV Raman when the latter was the head coach of Tamil Nadu? “You would always question. You would always want to be given answers so that he can understand what it is all about and get a better idea. That is something that should be taken in the right spirit and appreciated even by coaches. And that's exactly what I did with him. The simple fact of the matter is that as somebody who has taken on the responsibility of guiding next-generation cricketers, it's imperative that you try and provide all the answers that they are seeking.\"Ashwin finished his career as India's second-highest Test wicket-taker after Anil Kumble. Since the news of his retirement broke, several people thought the off-spinner called time early as he still had much to offer in international cricket. Could Ashwin have looked to surpass Anil Kumble? Raman reckons it all boils down to the individual; sometimes, milestones are the last thing on their mind.\"See, this is all absolutely left to the individual and how he/she feels at a given point in time. And no matter how much you feel there is, there is enough cricket left in him as of now. But as I said at the start of this chat, when a cricketer feels that enough is enough, mentally, I think that's the end of it. Because if somebody feels it's not enjoyable doing what it is, they are doing any longer, for example, even if you get up tomorrow morning and feel that it's enough to write, to talk, to interview people, enough, I'll do something else. You would also call your office and say, thank you enough,\" added Raman\"I've had enough of this. So, it's all about how much motivation is left in an individual to continue doing what he's been doing all these years. Yes, it would not have been an easy decision because almost up till now, his entire life has been about cricket. So, to give up something that he did so well for so long and all the things that go with it won't have been easy. But as I said, once you think that you've had enough, nothing else can keep you going.\"Time and time again, Ashwin has stated his desire to win the one elusive title that is still missing from his celebrated resume – the Ranji Trophy for Tamil Nadu. All signs point towards the off-spinner going all out to make the dream come true.\"See, the thing is that he's always been wanting to try and win a title for Tamil Nadu during his time. And I'm sure that being a guy who has shown whole-hearted commitment to any team that he plays for, he would try and do this for Tamil Nadu. And if he goes on to win the title, I think there will be a nice, well-rounded career, won't you say so?\" he says.\"His legacy is all about overcoming all the challenges, constantly learning, and constantly thinking about the game. And also living that clichéd thing of eating, breathing and sleeping cricket. I think it fits Ashwin. The other person who did that during his time and probably does it to a certain extent now is Sachin Tendulkar.\""}},{"headline":"Clarke gives ex-Australia captain's example to inspire Rohit's comeback with bat","pic":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/19/148x111/CRICKET-AUS-IND-10_1734637511903_1734637523105.jpg","summary":"Rohit Sharma has struggled with form in Test cricket since India's return to Test action in August earlier this year.","link":"/cricket/michael-clarke-gives-ex-australia-captains-example-to-inspire-rohit-sharmas-comeback-with-bat-he-will-tell-you-101734635487665.html","contents":{"image":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/19/550x309/CRICKET-AUS-IND-10_1734637511903_1734637523105.jpg","text":"Subscribe Now!

Rohit has struggled in Tests ever since the beginning of the home season in August earlier this year; in Australia, his performances only dipped further, with Rohit failing to breach double figures in Adelaide. The Indian captain failed again in Brisbane, as he batted in middle-order to accommodate the in-form KL Rahul at the opening spot.Former Australia captain Michael Clarke, during a conversation on ESPN Australia, hinted that Rohit has looked tentative and didn't play with his naturally aggressive intent, which has rewarded Rohit throughout his career. Clarke gave the example of Aaron Finch, who was also part of the panel, explaining how the former Aussie captain had a similar experience in red-ball cricket.“You never pick just based on form. He’s captain of the team, I’m definitely picking him. Rohit hasn’t started here, he took some time to get back into it. He wants some runs, and he’s an exceptional player,\" Clarke began.\"He plays in middle-order because he thinks it’s best for the team. I won’t make any change. KL Rahul is doing a great job at the top, I understand that. I don’t think it matters what format he plays; when he’s confident and backing himself, playing with aggressive intent, that’s where he is at his best.\"Finch is a good example. He will tell you, batting in Test cricket where the ball is moving, when you are a player who has dominated short-format cricket, it’s hard when your confidence drops.“I remember having conversations with Finchy, I’d rather have him go out and backing himself from ball one. Sometimes, it doesn’t look great, but that’s the way these boys play. They are X-factor players, match-winners. Rohit is such an important player in Indian team.”With the third Test ending in a draw in Brisbane, the five-Test series is poised for an exciting finish, as the action moves to Melbourne for the iconic Boxing Day Test.The series is currently level at 1-1, and Rohit would aim to make a mark with the bat when he returns to action on December 26."}},{"headline":"Chris Martin breaks silence on daughter Apple's Deb Ball: ‘Not something I…’The Coldplay star spilled the beans about attending Apple’s debutante ball in Paris last month. \"It’s so not something I ever thought I’d do,” he admitted.","pic":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/20/550x309/Applemartin_1733100532325_1734675314455.jpg","summary":"","link":"/entertainment/hollywood/coldplays-chris-martin-breaks-silence-on-daughter-apples-deb-ball-not-something-i-101734674987597.html","contents":{"image":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/20/550x309/Applemartin_1733100532325_1734675314455.jpg","text":"Subscribe Now!

A large shark is seen approaching from the right in shallow waters. Without hesitation, the shark attacks the crocodile’s head, thrashing violently for about 10 seconds before securing a firm grip and dragging the carcass into deeper waters. The predator briefly disappears beneath the surface, only to re-emerge and circle the floating crocodile.A post shared by Mako (@amazing.sharks)Sharks and crocodiles are both apex predators often inhabiting overlapping environments like coastal waters, leading to occasional competition for resources. However, according to American Oceans, direct confrontations between these two powerful creatures are uncommon due to their distinct hunting techniques, prey preferences, and habitats.Scenarios like scavenging from the same carcass can spark tension, but in most cases, conflicts are avoided. Sharks, known as opportunistic feeders across species, are quick to seize easy meals. The dead crocodile in Bedwell’s video likely presented an irresistible feast for the shark, eliminating any need for a struggle.(Also read: Batteries explode as crocodile chomps drone, smoke billows from jaws: 'Humans never learn')While sharks and crocodiles command equal respect as dominant marine and estuarine predators, their occasional interactions provide rare and fascinating insights into the dynamics of the natural world.The footage offers a rare glimpse into the dynamic and often brutal interactions within Australia’s wild coastal ecosystems.

She requested a cab of the ‘Rapido Economy’ class and got a Premium vehicle instead. Economy rides typically cost less than Premium ones, often using hatchbacks as cabs as opposed to the sedans that ply under the Premium category.In Ohshin’s case, however, the driver had also made his cab available under the Economy category, possibly in a bid to get more rides. However, he demanded that the techie pay him extra.

He followed it up with another perceived insult, calling the Mumbai techie a “Bhikhari ki aulad (Child of a beggar).”When the customer refused to rise to the bait, the Rapido driver got more belligerent.“Saste me chahiye paidal ja (Walk if you want to save money),” he told Ohshin.Ohshin told HT.com that she eventually booked an Uber and left the area.

You lay down the rules for the race, prepare the stadium or the ground and ensure everything the participants need for a fair and equal competition are provided. Now imagine that you also decide to participate in the same race. You get in line and bend down when you hear the words: on your marks, get set and go or hear the whistle. You run for your life, try and make sure you leave everyone behind.Wait, there’s more. Now further imagine you are also the umpire and part of the team that assesses that all the participants fought on fair grounds, violated no rules and did not cheat in any manner whatsoever. If your life wasn’t already hard enough, it just got a bit harder. You actually need to be present when the participants reach and cross the finishing line to make sure the final winner is picked on merit. It would be no surprise to anybody if you messed up one or even all three tasks assigned to you. You simply have too much on your plate.That’s precisely the situation state governments in India find themselves in when it comes to the mammoth task of providing free compulsory education to the country’s 400-odd million children through its complex and widespread primary and secondary school system. The Union government acts in a manner akin to the Olympic committee, to try and ensure that the basic rules of the game are followed but it is the states that run the race.The fact that the government is trying to do all three - rule setting, participation and regulation - has led to a situation where it fails to do justice to the main task: provide a high-quality education to its students. The idea is not to hold a torch for private unaided schools, a majority of whom are providing as poor quality of learning as their government counterparts, but two or three worrying developments have emerged as a consequence. The complete lack of regulation has led to two primary problems: government schools get with literally anything while new entrants into the private space struggle first to set up and then to stay in business. The lack of regulation of private schools also leads to an inability to separate the wheat from the chaff. So, while many less genuine players who are looking to make money, set up schools, the more authentic and serious players struggle with an endless burden of permissions and requirements to be met.Several average budget private schools in urban areas are like kirana shops, peddling wares that are slightly better than what the ration shops are selling. With no system of rating schools in place, to attract more students, schools undertake projects to enhance the infrastructure or buy equipment with good optical value but no proven impact on student learning. The poor quality of government schools has led to an increase in demand for private budget schools. The supply, however, is stagnant. With government policy creating high entry barriers in the sector, the quality of options has deteriorated as costs continued to rise. Entrants into the private school space need to get a certificate of recognition to operate as a school. (Section 18 of RTE). The requirements to get this certificate are stringent and the process of establishing a private school is fraught with bureaucratic hurdles, necessitating the acquisition of at least two other certificates: Essentiality Certificate and the Scheme of Management approval.This requires the founder to navigate a 30-point checklist, completing 68 procedural steps and assembling no less than 125 documents, including 29 documents for the Essentiality Certificate alone. Each of these steps requires interaction with numerous officials, with the entire process potentially taking up to five years due to legal and bureaucratic delays. In other words, it’s not the easiest space to get into. Another challenge for any private entrant is to get a UDISE (Unified District Information System for Education) number, which helps the authorities collate data and monitor schools. This is an online form where they need to upload documents and await verification whereas for government schools it is an automated allocation as soon as the school is commissioned. Similarly, private schools have to meet requirements like having a special educator for students with special needs and can be fined if they are found non-compliant. In contrast, government schools often function without even one teacher across grades, let alone ensuring that a special educator is available for children with special needs. The certificate of recognition requires compliance with minimum infrastructure including toilets, drinking water, pupil-teacher ratio, number of working days, and weather-proof buildings. Additionally, by-laws and rules made by the states under RTE or the respective state education acts mandate a minimum plot area, failing which schools may not be recognised. In several states, private schools are required to match government teacher salaries. The implication of this for a budget private school is tripling the school fees they charge from students. There are also periodic inspections riddled with unpredictability; schools cannot even freely set their admission policies or class size.This apart, where schools admit children under the RTE’s 25% reservation mandate, they wait for long periods to be reimbursed by the government. Many schools find themselves in a bind as they cannot pay teachers, electricity bills and rents, without getting paid or raising fees.What is worse is that certain state governments have shut down private schools, which they feel or claim are failing to meet the laid down norms: the state government, for example, shut 931 private schools in Punjab. Further, 219 private schools in Punjab have been shut through a court order dated 20.08.2013 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh because of non-compliance with Sections 18 and 19 of the RTE Act. More than 1300 private schools in Haryana have also been sent closure notices by the state government. This has translated to the displacement of around half a million children from the schools of their choice and triggered numerous litigations as private school owners dispute the orders. In many cases, private school promoters argue that the government schools are losing students to them due to their poor delivery and outcomes and the easiest way for them to fight this competition is to try and shut down the threat by convincing the authorities to throw the rule book at the private schools, even on flimsy pretexts.“In many cases, it is not clear to the founder why his or her school has been issued a notice when a government school nearby functions with the same gaps or flaws or even worse,” said Vikas Jhunjhunwala, who has been running two budget schools in Mehrauli and Ghaziabad since 2015 with 900 students in both and with an average fee of ₹800 a month. He added this is the single most important reform needed in India’s complex education edifice today.The good news however is that the national education policy (NEP) has clearly enunciated the need for urgent change. Experts in the sector have argued that for it to work, one, the State School Standards Authority (SSSA) must be backed by law. Two, its charter must explicitly commit to promoting the autonomy and accountability of all schools, empowering parents with information, which allows them to make informed decisions on where they would like their wards to study.Equally critical is the ways of working and governance of the regulator such that it puts private and public schools at par and treats both equally. Kapil Khurana, associate project director at Central Square Foundation (CSF), which is assisting states set up the SSSA, said that as a parent, one should be entitled and be able to see verified and comparable quality information about all the schools nearby and choose.Khurana added that if the state government could aggregate the same information at a panchayat, district, or state level, it can serve multiple purposes of system diagnosis and make the relevant stakeholders answerable, bringing in much needed accountability. “An authority that facilitates disclosure in the sector can solve many prevalent problems manifesting due to a lack of transparency and accountability,” he pointed out.With the NEP outlining this as a priority, many states have taken steps to set up SSSAs. Assam takes the lead in one of the most critical areas of reform needed in education with a legislation: Assam State School Standards Authority (SSSA) Bill, 2024, which aims to establish an independent SSSA in line with the suggestions of NEP 2020. This will help create an effective and transparent regulatory system based on a minimal set of standards for all stages of education including pre-school, across public, private and philanthropic schools in the state. The legislation has been welcomed by those who are invested in the education sector as it is the first that widens the ambit of regulation to include private and government schools. Some states like Maharashtra, Punjab, Sikkim, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh have notified or simply renamed their exam boards as the SSSA over the last three years but this remains more on paper especially since in most states it does not cover private schools. The Uttar Pradesh government has recently asked state officials to begin work on setting up a SSSA, a natural extension of its Mission Prerna, a massive state school education reform exercise that began in 2019.But so far only Assam has moved the needle on this reform in a meaningful way by introducing a comprehensive legislation and Bill. Unless more states follow Assam’s lead, India’s children will continue to suffer on account of the indifferent education on offer across the country."}},{"headline":"Mumbai boat crash: Search operation on for 7-year-old boy","pic":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/20/148x111/mumbai_boat_mumbai_ferry_1734676373092_1734676373635.jpg","summary":"Search operation on for 7-yr-old boy missing after ferry-Navy craft crash","link":"/india-news/mumbai-boat-crash-search-operation-on-for-7-year-old-boy-101734676157244.html","contents":{"image":"https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/12/20/550x309/mumbai_boat_mumbai_ferry_1734676373092_1734676373635.jpg","text":"Subscribe Now!

The tragedy struck when the speeding Navy craft undergoing engine trials lost control and collided with passenger ferry 'Neel Kamal' off near Mumbai coast. The ferry with more than 100 passengers was on its way from the Gateway of India to the Elephanta Island, a popular tourist attraction which has a collection of ancient caves. According to the documents issued by the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB), the boat had permission to carry 84 passengers and 6 crew members, but it was overloaded, a police official said. A case has been registered against the Navy craft driver at the Colaba police station, the official said.

A senior official of the MCA, while talking to PTI, claimed that the side was at times \"forced to hide\" him on the field due to his poor fitness, discipline and attitude. Shaw had expressed his frustration at not being picked in the 16-member squad for the Vijay Hazare Trophy in a viral social media post some days ago after being a part of the side's title-winning Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy campaign.\"In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, we were playing with 10 fielders as we were forced to hide Prithvi Shaw. The ball would pass near him and he would barely be able to get to it,\" the official said on conditions of anonymity.\"Even while batting, we could see he was troubled reaching to the ball. His fitness, discipline and attitude are poor and it is pretty simple, there cannot be different rules for different players,\" he claimed.\n\"Even the seniors in the team have started complaining about his attitude now,\" he added.During the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Shaw missed training sessions regularly after showing up at the team hotel at \"six in the morning\" being out for most of the night.The youngster has defended himself by sayin Shaw, who has attracted a lot of attention for his off-field activities and not doing his talent justice by focussing on his game, would not get any favour from such social media posts, the official said.\"You would be wrong to think such posts on social media would have any impact on the Mumbai selectors and the MCA,\" he added.Shaw's teammate and Mumbai captain Shreyas Iyer too had issued a stern statement on the night Mumbai defeated Madhya Pradesh in the final to win the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.\"He needs to get his work ethics right. And if he does that, (the) sky's the limit for him,\" Iyer told reporters in Bengaluru.\"We can't babysit anyone, right? He has played so much of cricket. Everyone has given him inputs. At the end of the day, it's his job to figure out things for himself. And he has also done it in the past. It's not that he hasn't,\" he added.Shaw was earlier left out of Mumbai's Ranji Trophy squad for similar reasons in October after which he was given a specific fitness program to work on at the MCA Academy.\"He is not following that as well properly,\" the official said.Shaw broke into the scene amid a lot of hype, making his Test debut in 2018 as an 18-year-old in a home series against the West Indies.His lone century in the format was on that exciting debut but since then, he has appeared in just four more Tests, the last of these being against Australia four years ago.His ODI and T20 International career has also failed to take off and he hasn't played any white-ball cricket for India since 2021. These are markedly underwhelming statistics for a player, who was touted as the next big thing in Indian cricket just a few years ago.Several former players have expressed their concern about his antics and attitude both on and off the field. A recent low for him was failing to find any takers in the IPL auction despite coming in with a relatively low base price of Rs 75 lakh.\"I'll tell you one thing. No one is Shaw's enemy. He is his own enemy,\" the MCA official stated, voicing the frustration that the cricket fraternity in India has felt over him not living up to the early promise.(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\n                                    Advertisement\n                                AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement"}},{"headline":"Watch: Abhishek And Aishwarya Record Aaradhya's Performance (Together)","link":"https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/watch-abhishek-and-aishwarya-bachchan-record-aaradhyas-performance-on-phone-together-7291596#pfrom=home-ndtv_lateststories","contents":{"text":"Abhishek and Aishwarya pictured togetherAmitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan had a rare family reunion recently, courtesy Aaradhya's annual school function.

Consequently, he travelled to the faraway continent to prove his point. Upon reaching there, Mr Campanella realised that the Sun does not rise in Antarctica during the southern hemisphere's summer and that everyone else was right.\"Sometimes you are wrong in life.

One of the casualties of the changes that have been made was opening batter Nathan McSweeney who was touted to be the long-term replacement for retired David Warner. The man replacing him is 19-year-old Sam Konstas who impressed many with his century in the Prime Minister's XI practice game against Team India in Canberra before the pink-ball Test.McSweeney's exclusion from the squad isn't the only big change as marquee pacer Josh Hazlewood has also been ruled out of the remainder of the series. Hazlewood sustained an injury in the Brisbane Test that made him unavailable for the final two days of the match too. Australia have also added, Sean Abbott, Jhye Richardson and Beau Webster in the squad for the final two matches of the series.\"The squad provides options as to how we structure the XI for the final two Tests of the series,\" Cricket Australia's chairman of Selectors George Bailey in an official statement.\n\"Sam gets a call-up to the Test squad for the first time. His style of batting offers a point of difference and we look forward to watching his game develop further.Bailey said that Australia are still counting on McSweeney's potential and it was a difficult decision to drop him from the squad for the 3rd and the 4th Test.\"We remain confident Nathan has the ability and temperament to succeed at Test level in the future. It was a difficult decision to leave him out.\"It has clearly been a challenge at the top of the order for batters throughout the series and we want to provide the option of a different line-up for the next two matches.\"Scott Boland and Jhye Richardson unarguably remain the top two options to replace Josh Hazlewood in the playing XI for Australia.\"In the absence of Josh Hazlewood, Jhye provides further options in the fast bowling space. It has been pleasing to see his successful return throughout the early part of the domestic summer,\" he added.Australia squad for last two Tests against India: Pat Cummins (c), Steve Smith, Marnus Labuschagne, Sam Konstas, Usman Khawaja, Travis Head, Mitchell Marsh, Beau Webster, Sean Abbott, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Jhye Richardson, Alex Carey, Scott Boland, and Josh Inglis.\n                                    Advertisement\n                                AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement"}},{"headline":"The Deadliest Day In History With 830,000 Lives Lost In A Disaster","pic":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/92dc365g_great-wall-of-china_625x300_20_December_24.jpeg?downsize=254:143&w=254","link":"https://www.ndtv.com/feature/1556-shaanxi-earthquake-the-deadliest-day-in-history-with-830-000-lives-lost-in-a-disaster-7290680#pfrom=home-ndtv_lateststories_topstoriesImg","contents":{"text":"Imagine a day when a single natural disaster claims nearly one million lives-a true apocalypse. When you think of the loss that this disaster caused, the scale of destruction is almost unthinkable when you consider that it occurred at a time when the global population was only about 5% of what it is today.This was the 1556 Shaanxi Earthquake, which occurred on January 23, 1556, in the Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces of China. The earthquake, estimated to be of magnitude 8, is considered the deadliest in recorded history, with an estimated 830,000 lives lost.The quake caused widespread destruction, including the collapse of structures of that time, homes, and entire cities. Apart from the immediate loss of life, the long-term effects included famine, disease, and social upheaval. Considering the scale of the disaster, it is still a sobering reminder of the power of nature and the fragility of human life. The catastrophic toll of the Shaanxi earthquake is even worse when compared to today's population size, thus making it an event of unimaginable scale for its time.According to most accounts, this fateful date saw more human lives extinguished than any other day in history, with the vast majority of these deaths occurring in the Shaanxi province of northwest China.According to the South China Morning Post, this most devastating earthquake in Chinese history was also known as the Jiajing earthquake, which occurred during the reign of the Ming dynasty's Jiajing Emperor. The horrific quake, which occurred simultaneously in the present-day provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Gansu, could be felt as far as the southern coast. A plaque, erected three years later, described how \"cracks appeared on the ground, out of which water gushed ... City walls and houses disappeared into the ground, and plains suddenly folded into hills ... The Yellow and Wei rivers were inundated, and the [permanently silted] waters of the Yellow River were clear for several days\".The most terrible outcome of the Jiajing earthquake was the reported death toll of more than 830,000 people, which, if accurate, would make it the deadliest earthquake in history. The disaster further weakened the Ming dynasty, which was then already in a state of steady decline.Track Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world"}},{"headline":"\"I'll Be Walking Out With You...\": Ashwin's Reply To Kohli's Retirement Post","pic":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/5iboa6f8_virat-kohli-and-r-ashwin-bcci_625x300_20_December_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=254,height=143&w=254","link":"https://sports.ndtv.com/australia-vs-india-2024-25/ill-be-walking-out-with-you-r-ashwins-reply-to-virat-kohlis-retirement-post-is-pure-gold-7290525#pfrom=home-ndtv_lateststories_topstoriesImg","contents":{"image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-12/5iboa6f8_virat-kohli-and-r-ashwin-bcci_625x300_20_December_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605","text":"As the cricket world flooded social media with its tributes for Ravichandran Ashwin, a post from Virat Kohli stood out.

He even shared a lovely post for the retiring spinner on social media, recalling their early days together. Responding to Kohli's post, Ashwin summed up the bond they have.\"I've played with you for 14 years and when you told me today you're retiring, it made me a bit emotional and the flashbacks of all those years playing together came to me. I've enjoyed every bit of the journey with you ash, your skill and match-winning contributions to Indian cricket are second to none and you will always and always be remembered as a legend of Indian cricket. Wish you nothing but the best in your life with your family and everything else that it unfolds for you. With massive respect and lots of love to you and your close ones.

Brewed using freshly ground beans in a traditional metal drip filter, this beloved beverage is more than just a drink - it's a ritual. Recently, a video showcasing the unique South Indian coffee experience went viral, capturing the attention of both locals and foreigners. The video shared on Instagram, features a Tamil Nadu man and his South Indian family dining at a restaurant with his Dutch in-laws. The humorous caption reads, \"Let's teach Dutchies how to drink South Indian coffee.\" The clip shows a tray filled with stainless steel glasses of coffee and a traditional dabara - a small metal cup used for both brewing and serving.What follows is a demonstration of the iconic South Indian pouring technique: coffee is poured from a height between vessels to create the perfect froth. The froth, a crucial element of the perfect cup, is made with precision and care. The Dutch visitors, eager to learn, try replicating the technique, their expressions showing genuine enjoyment.The caption emphasises the deep connection between South Indians and their coffee, stating, \"South Indian & coffee, you can't separate both.\" It also highlights the importance of the froth, with a playful Tamil term \"aathu rathu\" or \"aathuffying\" describing the pouring method that makes the coffee both drinkable and frothy. For many South Indians, a coffee without froth isn't really coffee.The video also features the creator's wife, originally from the Netherlands, who has already mastered the art of making South Indian coffee. However, it's the creator's mother-in-law, who prefers black coffee over the milk-based variety, that steals the show. Despite her preference, she eagerly learns the frothing technique, adding a fun twist to the viral moment.Take a look at the video here:A post shared by Prabhu Visha (@prabhuvisha)Were you aware of this technique of drinking coffee?
